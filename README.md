# Portfolio-Website-Demo
A simple and fun website built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript as a demo for the final project of the Schoolhouse.world series "Web Development through Inspect." This was a 6-week long course for learners around the world, hosted virtually on the Schoolhouse.world platform, which covered simple web development with HTML, CSS, and Javascript with an emphasis on its real-world applications. The course materials can be found at [this website](https://108charlotte.github.io/Web-Dev-Course/)! The course concluded with a final project and showcase to create a simple personal website and deploy on GitHub pages. 

This website is from the live demo, and the website from the recording on the course website (linked above) can be found [here](https://108charlotte.github.io/Portfolio-website/) and the code [here](https://github.com/108charlotte/Portfolio-website).
